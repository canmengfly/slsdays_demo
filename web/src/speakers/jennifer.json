            "title": "Monitoring and Debugging Serverless",
            "abstract" : "A function is deployed, and alerts go off. When our intrepid site reliability engineer responds to the change in availability, she begins the task of debugging and implementing new tests to catch the issue in future deployments. While the nature and complexity of computing changes, the need for specialized operations engineering skills increases. \r\nIn this talk, we examine the role of Operations, how it has evolved with the advent of new compute paradigms. Weâ€™ll examine two critical areas of operational readiness of monitoring and debugging."
