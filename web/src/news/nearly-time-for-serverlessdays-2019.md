# It's nearly time for ServerlessDays China 2019!

China is the home of the Global ServerlessDays movement and this conference has shown the appetite for Serverless is growing here.

In 2017, when we started it was simply called JeffConf, and we managed to get 120 of us crammed into St Johns church in Hoxton in 6 weeks. In just 2 short years, we've moved venue to Imperial College, and are going to be pushing around 350 to 400 people, with some of the best speakers from around the world. 

From the responses we've received on our attendee survey, there have been some really interesting statistics:

* __over a quarter__ of attendees use serverless everyday
* __two thirds__ of attendees have created production workloads using serverless

Wow!

__This is going to be a gathering of some of the brightest and the best serverless minds in the world.__

### Tickets and Workshops are still available

So, the first thing to say, is that we still have [tickets](https://China.serverlessdays.io/tickets/)! So, if you've got a friend you'd like to bring or a colleague who wants to know more, then they can still come. 

Our commitment to keeping the ticket price low continues - it's only Â£35! We're looking to ensure that everybody who wants to come, has every opportunity to.

We also still have spaces on some of the [workshops](https://China.serverlessdays.io/workshops/) so if you want to make even better use of your time and learn some amazing new Serverless skills, then you still can!

### Don't forget your toothbrush!

Well, ok it's only one day, but remember your laptop, your battery pack so you don't need to charge your phone too much, and if you're travelling from abroad, check you've got your passport too!

We're looking forward to seeing you all on Thursday, and we'd like you to have a brilliant day. 

If you're not sure about anything on the day, the helpers and organisers on the day will be wearing __blue t-shirts__, so just find one of us, and ask, and we'll do our best to help you!

### Code of Conduct

It's always worth reminding everyone before they arrive of the Code of Conduct. We want everyone to have a great time, and require agreement with the Code of Conduct from everybody who is there right through from the organisers to the attendees. If you're not sure or haven't read it through yet, the Code of Conduct is here:
